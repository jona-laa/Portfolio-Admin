## Admin / CMS for Portfolio
Admin/CMS for my [Portfolio](http://studenter.miun.se/~jola1803/dt173g/portfolio/client/) page.

This project was initially developed in HTML, SASS, JavaScript with a little help from Gulp to speed up the process. PHP additions were so minor, this made the most sense. 

### Tech Used During Dev Process
* HTML
* SASS
* JavaScript(ES6)
* Gulp
* PHP

### Functionality
* Simple log in/out
* Post/Publish content
* Update content
* Delete content  

The design is really just a clone of the [Portfolio-Client](https://github.com/jona-laa/Portfolio-Client), with some minor adjustments to fit the purpose. 

## Usage
* `git clone https://github.com/jona-laa/Portfolio-Admin.git`
* move folder to AMP-stack development environment. 
* Usually found at http://localhost:8080/portfolio_admin/
* A config.php file has to be created with credentials, token, and a domain variable.
* A database is needed, as well as a REST API. This project is made to function with [this](https://github.com/jona-laa/Portfolio-Server) REST API.
