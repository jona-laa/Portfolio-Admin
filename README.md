## Dev branch for Portfolio Admin
Reason for this is the client was initially developed in a straight up HTML, SASS, GULP environment, which really boosted the productivity. The additional php was so minor, it wouldn't have made sense to do it any other way.  

The design is really just a "clone" of the [Portfolio-Client](https://github.com/jona-laa/Portfolio-Client) with some minor adjustments to fit the purpose.
