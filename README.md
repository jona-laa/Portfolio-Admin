## Admin / CMS for Portfolio
Admin/CMS for my [Portfolio](https://github.com/jona-laa/Portfolio-Client) page.

This project was initially developed in HTML, SASS, JavaScript with a little help from Gulp to speed up the process. PHP additions were so minor, this made the most sense. 

### Tech Used During Dev Process
* HTML
* SASS
* JavaScript(ES6)
* Gulp
* PHP

### Functionality
* Simple log in/out
* Post/Publish content
* Update content
* Delete content  

The design is really just a clone of the [Portfolio-Client](https://github.com/jona-laa/Portfolio-Client), with some minor adjustments to fit the purpose.
