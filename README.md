## Dev branch for Portfolio Admin
Reason for this is that I initially developed it in a straight up HTML, SASS, GULP environment, which really boosted the productivity. The additional php, needed for a simple login, was so minor that it wouldn't have made sense to do it any other way.  

The design is really just a "clone" of the [Portfolio-Client](https://github.com/jona-laa/Portfolio-Client) with some minor adjustments to fit the purpose.
